## How to use

Run `python process_images.py` to generate 64 60x60 squares for each chessboard image in the `../raw_data folder`.

## Todo

* Label images in `../raw_data` denoting color of square, where there is a piece, color and type of piece.
* Create artificial data by rotating squares, adding blur, shifting squares, etc. 
* Train simple model to determine the color of square and the color of a piece if there is a piece.
* (Optional) Train neural network to determine color and type of piece for each square.
